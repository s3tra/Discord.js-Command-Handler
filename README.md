[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/s3tra/discord.js-command-handler/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/s3tra/discord.js-command-handler)

This is a simple command handler for Discord bots using the discord.js library. It streamlines the process of setting up a bot, allowing you to run slash commands right out of the box with just a bot token.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a .env file with the "TOKEN".
3. The included sample command (`ping.js`) is ready to use. To add more commands, simply clone the `ping.js` file and customize the new command file.

That's it! You're ready to start building your bot with ease.
